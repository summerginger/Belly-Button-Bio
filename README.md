# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard [click here](https://summerginger.github.io/Belly-Button-Bio/)

# Project Overview
This project is to create a dashboard that displays demographic information of the bacteria data for each volunteer. The project includes the following:

•	Complete the demographic information panel for the selected volunteer ID number.

•	The bar chart shows the top 10 bacterial species in a volunteer's navel. 

•	The bubble chart provides the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer's navel.

•	The gauge chart demonstrates the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

### Purpose
This project aims to help Raza present a website to visualize the bacteria found in each participant's belly button. These bacteria are being studied as a means to create improbable beef. If synthetic meat identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
